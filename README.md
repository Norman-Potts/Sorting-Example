# Sorting-Example

 This program tests out how fast each sort algorithm can sort an array of random numbers.
 Sort algorithms in tested are quick sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort. 
 The sort algorithms are tested three times with different array sizes. 
 Array sizes are 10, 1000, and 10000.
